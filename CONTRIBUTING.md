### Standards, used in THUNDERSTORM kernel
* use tab = 2 spaces
* snake case is much more preferred
* Allman \ BSD indentation style, or linux kernel style. (But Allman \ BSD is prefered and much easier).
* The use of ["The power of ten rules"](http://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf) is prefered(if possible).
